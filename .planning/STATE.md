# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Users can watch live-streaming prices, trade a simulated portfolio, and chat with an AI assistant that can both analyze and execute trades -- all in a single, polished dark-themed terminal UI.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 complete. LLM chat integration fully done (models, service, route, LLM calling, action auto-execution). Next: Phase 4 Frontend Foundation.

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (LLM Chat Integration) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Phase 03 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-02 -- Completed 03-02 (LLM integration + action auto-execution)

Progress: [######....] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 3.0min
- Total execution time: 0.30 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-database-foundation | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 02-portfolio-watchlist-apis | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 03-llm-chat-integration | 2 | 6min | 3.0min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (4min), 02-02 (3min), 03-01 (3min), 03-02 (3min)
- Trend: Steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases following strict dependency chain (DB -> APIs -> LLM -> Frontend -> Viz -> Docker)
- Roadmap: Portfolio and Watchlist APIs combined in Phase 2 (watchlist sync depends on price cache, trade execution is prerequisite for LLM auto-execution)
- Roadmap: Frontend split into two phases (foundation + visualizations) to keep Phase 4 verifiable before advanced charting
- 01-01: Settings not instantiated at module level (use get_settings() to avoid breaking tests)
- 01-01: SQL files loaded at module import time via pathlib for efficiency
- 01-01: Pool uses statement_cache_size=0 for Neon serverless compatibility
- 01-01: Fixed UUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 for default user
- 01-02: Health router registered at module level (not inside lifespan) since it only needs db_pool from app.state
- 01-02: Route modules export `router`, imported and registered via app.include_router()
- 02-01: Service layer pattern adopted -- routes stay thin, all business logic in services/ for reuse by LLM chat
- 02-01: Epsilon comparison (abs < 1e-9) for zero-quantity position deletion to avoid float precision issues
- 02-01: record_snapshot called after trade transaction commits (not inside), ensuring snapshot reads committed state
- 02-01: Cash amounts rounded to 2 decimal places in service layer to prevent float drift
- 02-02: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + RETURNING id pattern for duplicate detection (cleaner than catching UniqueViolationError)
- 02-02: Background tasks cancelled before DB pool close to prevent shutdown errors
- 02-02: Market source sync (add_ticker/remove_ticker) always called after DB mutation succeeds
- 03-01: User message persisted to DB before LLM call to survive LLM failures (Pitfall 6)
- 03-01: Mock mode bypasses _call_llm entirely using settings.llm_mock flag
- 03-01: _execute_actions is a stub returning empty results (implemented in Plan 03-02)
- 03-02: acompletion import moved to module level for test patchability
- 03-02: Action execution wraps each action in try/except, collecting errors alongside successes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RESOLVED: LiteLLM `extra_body` structured output -- works correctly with response_format=LLMResponse (validated in Phase 3)
- Research flag: @nivo/treemap React 19 compatibility needs verification in Phase 5
